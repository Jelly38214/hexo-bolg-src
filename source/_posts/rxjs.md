Recently I am very interested in Rxjs for stream thinking.
This post will record what I learn from Rxjs
There is some demo in [codepen](https://codepen.io/caozheng/pen/WdEbKE),which has a completed environment to use Rxjs version 5.And this'is the rxjs [reference](http://cn.rx.js.org/) writed in chinnese.
