Tonight I find a library in youtube which is very easy to decode a audio and draw it's spectrum and make it visualize 
[p5.js](https://p5js.org) which is javascript library that starts with the origin goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web

I use it to make a demo at [codepen](https://codepen.io/caozheng/pen/opzaJr?editors=0010).
If you open it slowly even fail, maybe you should have a vpn. Have fun.
