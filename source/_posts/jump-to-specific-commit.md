> Conclusion: Jump to specific commit of a module in github

`Background`: Today, I wanna to watch Vue's sources and I remember someone said that the way best way to learn sources is to see author's commit in github, let author to teach you how he's code.
So I come to github and Vue's commit page.

1. remember total commit
