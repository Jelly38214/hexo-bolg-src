### Factory Method Pattern

```typescript
/**
 * The Creator class declares the facotor method that is supposed to
 * return an object of a Product class. The Creator's subclass usually
 * provide the implementation of this method
 *
 */

interface Product {
  operation(): string;
}

// TS allow us to define an abstract class using keyword abstract
abstract class Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation
   * of the factory method
   */
  public abstract factoryMethod(): Product;

  /**
   * Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is not creating products.
   * Usually, it contains some core business logic that relies on Product object,
   * returned by the factory method. Subclasses can indirectly change that business logic
   * by overfiding the factory method and returning a different type of product from it.
   */
  public someOperation(): string {
    // Call the factory method to create a Produc object.
    const product = this.factoryMethod();
    return `Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with ${product.operation()}`;
  }
}

/**
 * Concrete Creators override the factory method in order to change
 * the resulting product's type.
 */
class ConcreteCreator1 extends Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the signature of the method still uses the abstract product
   * type, even though the concrete product is actually returned from the method.
   * This way the Creator can stay independent of conrete product classes.
   */
  public factoryMethod(): Product {
    return new ConcreteProduct1();
  }
}

class ConcreteCreator2 extends Creator {
  public factoryMethod(): Product {
    return new ConcreteProduct2();
  }
}

/**
 * Concrete Products provide various implementations of the Product interface.
 */
class ConcreteProduct1 implements Product {
  public operation(): string {
    return "Result of the ConreteProduct1";
  }
}

class ConcreteProduct2 implements Product {
  public operation(): string {
    return "Result of the ConcreteProduct2";
  }
}

/**
 * The client code works with an instance of a concrete creator, albeit through its base interface.
 * As long as the client keeps working with the creator via the base interface,
 * you can pass it any creator's subclass.
 */
function clientCode(creator: Creator) {
  console.log(
    "Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works"
  );
  console.log(creator.someOperation());
}

const creator1 = new ConcreteCreator1();
const creator2 = new ConcreteCreator2();

clientCode(creator1);
clientCode(creator2);
```

### Strategy
```typescript
  /**
 * The Context defines the interface of interest to clients.
 */
class Context {
  /**
   * @type {Strategy} The Context maintains a reference to one of the Strategy
   * objects. The Context does not know the concrete class of a strategy.
   * It should work with all strategy via the Strategy interface.
   */
  private strategy: Strategy;

  /**
   * Usually, the Context accepts a strategy through the constructor,
   * but also provides a setter to change it at runtime.
   */
  constructor(strategy: Strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  /**
   * Usually, the Context allows replacing a Strategy object at runtime.
   */
  public setStrategy(strategy: Strategy) {
    this.strategy = strategy;
  }

  /**
   * The Context delegates some work to the Strategy object instead of
   * implementing multiple versions of the algorithm on its own.
   */
  public doSomeBusinessLogin(): void {
    console.log(
      "Context: Sorting data using the strategy (not sure how it do it)"
    );
    const result = this.strategy.doAlgorithm(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]);
    console.log(result.join(","));
  }
}

/**
 * The Strategy interface declares operation common to all supported 
 * versions of some algorithm. 
 * 
 * The Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by Concrete Strategies.
 */
interface Strategy {
  doAlgorithm(data: string[]): string[];
}

/**
 * Concrete Strategies implement the algorithm while following the base
 * Strategy interface. The interface makes them interchangeable in the Context. 
 */
class ConcreteStrategyA implements Strategy {
  public doAlgorithm(data: string[]): string[] {
    return data.sort();
  }
}

class ConcreteStrategyB implements Strategy {
  public doAlgorithm(data: string[]): string[] {
    return data.reverse();
  }
}

/**
 * The client code picks a concrete strategy and passes it to the context.
 * The client should be aware of the difference between strategies in order
 * to make the right choice.
 */
const context = new Context(new ConcreteStrategyA());
console.log('Client: Strategy is set to normal sorting');
context.doSomeBusinessLogin();

console.log('');

console.log('Client: Strategy is set to reverse sorting');
context.setStrategy(new ConcreteStrategyB());
context.doSomeBusinessLogin();
```
