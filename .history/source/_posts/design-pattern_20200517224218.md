## Factory Method Pattern

```typescript
/**
 * The Creator class declares the facotor method that is supposed to
 * return an object of a Product class. The Creator's subclass usually
 * provide the implementation of this method
 *
 */

interface Product {
  operation(): string;
}

// TS allow us to define an abstract class using keyword abstract
abstract class Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the Creator may also provide some default implementation
   * of the factory method
   */
  public abstract factoryMethod(): Product;

  /**
   * Also note that, despite its name, the Creator's primary responsibility is not creating products.
   * Usually, it contains some core business logic that relies on Product object,
   * returned by the factory method. Subclasses can indirectly change that business logic
   * by overfiding the factory method and returning a different type of product from it.
   */
  public someOperation(): string {
    // Call the factory method to create a Produc object.
    const product = this.factoryMethod();
    return `Creator: The same creator's code has just worked with ${product.operation()}`;
  }
}

/**
 * Concrete Creators override the factory method in order to change
 * the resulting product's type.
 */
class ConcreteCreator1 extends Creator {
  /**
   * Note that the signature of the method still uses the abstract product
   * type, even though the concrete product is actually returned from the method.
   * This way the Creator can stay independent of conrete product classes.
   */
  public factoryMethod(): Product {
    return new ConcreteProduct1();
  }
}

class ConcreteCreator2 extends Creator {
  public factoryMethod(): Product {
    return new ConcreteProduct2();
  }
}

/**
 * Concrete Products provide various implementations of the Product interface.
 */
class ConcreteProduct1 implements Product {
  public operation(): string {
    return "Result of the ConreteProduct1";
  }
}

class ConcreteProduct2 implements Product {
  public operation(): string {
    return "Result of the ConcreteProduct2";
  }
}

/**
 * The client code works with an instance of a concrete creator, albeit through its base interface.
 * As long as the client keeps working with the creator via the base interface,
 * you can pass it any creator's subclass.
 */
function clientCode(creator: Creator) {
  console.log(
    "Client: I'm not aware of the creator's class, but it still works"
  );
  console.log(creator.someOperation());
}

const creator1 = new ConcreteCreator1();
const creator2 = new ConcreteCreator2();

clientCode(creator1);
clientCode(creator2);
```
